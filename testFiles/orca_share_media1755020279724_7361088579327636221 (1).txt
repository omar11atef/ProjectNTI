Project Task – Zomato Bangalore Restaurants Dataset

You are provided with the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants dataset from Kaggle. Your task is divided into three main parts:

1. Data Analysis & EDA
Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset.

Answer the key questions mentioned in the dataset description.

2. Classification Models
Build multiple machine learning classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Build one Neural Network classification model.

Compare the accuracy of all models.

Select the best performing ML model (highest accuracy) and keep the Neural Network model as well.

3. Deployment with Streamlit
Create a Streamlit web app with two main pages:

a. Analysis Page

Display the visualizations and key findings from your EDA.

b. Prediction Page

Input form to enter details of a new restaurant.

On submission, show two predictions:

Prediction from the best ML model.

Prediction from the Neural Network model.

after that deployment on Streamlit Cloud
Deploy your app on Streamlit Cloud so it can be accessed online.

If the dataset is too large for deployment, create a smaller sampled version (e.g., 1–2% of the data) that still represents the full dataset.
